# LiLab

Dr. Li's lab specializes in cancer system immunology and oral carcinogenesis, employing a multi-omics and computational approach to unravel the complexities of tumor initiation and progression. We have developed advanced computational tools to analyze the tumor microenvironment and immune infiltration, providing insights into the immune landscape's role in cancer development and therapy response. Combining multi-omics and molecular biology techniques, we conduct in vivo and in vitro studies and explore immunotherapy, identifying key molecules with potential for cancer prevention.
